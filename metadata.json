  "description": "QR2 is a verification token designed to connect real-world assets with blockchain integrity through QR authentication. The protocol powers the creation of asset-linked accounts that record authenticity, ownership, and provenance within Solana parallel runtime. Each QR node embeds hashed identifiers and metadata into immutable on-chain storage. Every QR scan triggers a hashed event containing asset metadata and ownership state, recorded through smart contracts and verified using asymmetric encryption and multi-signature authorization.",
